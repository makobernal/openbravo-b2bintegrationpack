============================

This project was originaly hosted in the Openbravo Forge, more details can be found at http://centralrepository.openbravo.com/heartbeat-server/org.openbravo.forge.ui/ForgeProjectDetail/b2bintegration

The B2B Integration modules for Openbravo ERP were developed as part of the work of my MS thesis in 2011, althought they were fully functional at the time. Openbravo ERP has been updated since, so compatibility with the current versions is not guaranteed. Moreover, some of the capabilities that this modules provided have been since implemented in the core version (through the self-service portal capabilities).

============================

The B2B Integration framework is a collection of interdependent modules that provide several B2B Integration capabilities to Openbravo ERP, such as Shared Masterdata, B2B PO Management, Vendor Managed Inventory and Evaluated Receipt Settlement.

The B2B Integration project aims to build and maintain a common framework for the different modules and solutions which implement some form of Business-To-Business (B2B) integration along the supply and value chain. Nowadays, It is mainly a Supplier Portal. Suppliers can track POs, Shipments, Invoices and Payments. Furthermore, they are in charge of their Company, Product, and Pricelists information, so that the company which implemented Openbravo and the B2B Portal will engage with their suppliers electronically.
